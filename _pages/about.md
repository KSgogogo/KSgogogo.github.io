I am currently a lecturer at Wuhan University of Science and Technology.

Since 2013, I have been studying at the School of Computer Science, Wuhan University, where I earned my Bachelor's and Ph.D. degrees, supervied by Professor Tieyun Qian (钱铁云). 

My research interests focus on recommender systems, with an emphasis on sequential recommendation, Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation, and generative recommendation. I have published 10+ papers at well-known conferences and journals, such as AAAI, EMNLP, ACM TOIS, and IEEE TKDE. In the future, I aim to explore the potential applications of large language models to the POI recommendation or urban computing. 

 If you are interested in my study, please feel free to email me at sunke@wust.edu.cn.
